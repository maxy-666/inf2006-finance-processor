# INF2006 Project: Cloud-Native Financial Document Processor (AIaaS)

## üéØ Project Overview
This project is an **AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS)** platform designed to automate and digitise financial functions. It will process uploaded documents (invoices, receipts) by using a multi-stage machine learning pipeline to perform OCR, layout analysis, entity extraction, validation, and auto-categorisation.

Our goal is to create a robust, scalable, and secure system that demonstrates competency in:
* **Cloud Architecture & IaC**: Fully automated, reproducible deployment on AWS.
* **Big Data Analytics**: Processing a large corpus of documents and leveraging structured/unstructured data.
* **AI-as-a-Service**: Integrating and orchestrating multiple advanced ML models for a practical business solution.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Proposed Architecture (Mid-Term PoC)
The initial Proof-of-Concept (PoC) focuses on establishing the secure, serverless ingest pipeline:

1.  **Client/UI**: Uploads the document via a secure endpoint.
2.  **API Gateway**: Acts as the single entry point.
3.  **AWS Lambda**: Triggers the first stage of processing.
4.  **Amazon S3**: Stores the raw document securely.
5.  **AWS Textract**: Performs the initial Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

*(***Future Note:*** We will update this section with the Architecture Diagram once the PoC is deployed and link to the full Technical Report.)*
